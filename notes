what is in-place algorithm
An in-place algorithm is an algorithm that does not need an extra space and produces an output in the same memory
 that contains the data by transforming the input ‘in-place’.
 However, a small constant extra space used for variables is allowed.
 Which Sorting Algorithms are In-Place and which are not?
 In Place: Bubble sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Heapsort.
 Not In-Place: Merge Sort. Note that merge sort requires O(n) extra space.
 What about QuickSort? Why is it called In-Place?
 QuickSort uses extra space for recursive function calls.
 It is called in-place according to broad definition as extra space required is not used to manipulate input,
 but only for recursive calls.

 Brute Force approach finds all the possible solutions and selects desired solution per given the constraints.
 - Dynamic Programming also uses Brute Force approach to find the OPTIMUM solution, either maximum or minimum.
 - Backtracking also uses Brute Force approach but to find ALL the solutions.
 - Solutions to the Backtracking problems can be represented as State-Space Tree.
 - The constrained applied to find the solution is called Bounding function.
 - Backtracking follows Depth-First Search method.
 - Branch and Bound is also a Brute Force approach, which uses Breadth-First Search method.
